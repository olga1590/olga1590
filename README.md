### Why I decided to study AI?
1. I realized that I need to develop myself and the field of AI makes it possible to constantly improve, studying new development trends
2. I believe that with AI I'll be able to create outstanding products that benefit society from intangible things - from data
3. I have always accepted the challenges that life has given me: getting into the university with the most competitive faculty, getting a job at a promising bank with no experience in banking, getting a scholarship and enrolling in a master's program in South Korea and successfully complete it, working as a full-time employee in a large hospital, even though I am a foreigner. 
Learning AI and working in it is also a kind of challenge for me, and I am sure that I will be able to accept this challenge and achieve amazing results both for myself and for a dynamically developing world.
